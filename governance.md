# Governance

Loomio has a board of directors in charge of long-term strategy, compliance, and risk management, approve major transactions or partnerships etc...

They meet monthly, and collaborate together on Loomio.

The constitution requires at least 40% of directors to be co-op members. Currently this figure is 80% - we're likely to bring in another external director soon.

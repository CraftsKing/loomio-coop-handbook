# Governance

Loomio has a board of directors in charge of long-term strategy, compliance, and risk management, approve major transactions or partnerships etc...

- bringing business and other subject-area expertise to critiquing and providing accountability on the member-created strategy
- ensuring good governance by making sure we've got the right people & processes to deliver our strategy
- making sure the company complies with the law

They meet monthly, and collaborate together on Loomio.

The constitution requires at least 40% of directors to be co-op members. Currently this figure is 80% - we're likely to bring in another external director soon.

My first stab: I see the board as responsible for

- bringing business and other subject-area expertise to critiquing and providing accountability on the member-created strategy
- ensuring good governance by making sure we've got the right people & processes to deliver our strategy 
- making sure the company complies with the law

Michael I wonder if you might add something about our particular role vis-a-vis investors

The board balances opportunity and risk, working on behalf of member shareholders and investors to guide

Here is a simple definition from the IOD - What is a board?

A board is:

- a group who meet regularly to look at the performance and strategic progress of the company
- at least one independent director and other owner-operator directors (executive directors)
- a group who can separate themselves from the day-to-day operations and take a birds-eye view of the business
- a group who can debate the difficult issues and come out with a clear decision for the future of the company
ultimately, a group who guides, and is committed to, the company.

Most of this applies to Loomio.

I'd add that the board balances opportunity and risk, working on behalf of member shareholders and investors to guide and support the management of the company (via coordinators).

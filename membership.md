What does it mean to be a member of the Loomio Workers’ Cooperative? 


Background
Loomio is a worker-owned cooperative, and a social enterprise. As a worker co-op, Loomio is collectively owned by the people working in it. As a social enterprise, Loomio’s central purpose is to further a social mission: making it easy for anyone, anywhere to participate in decisions that affect their lives. 

Membership
Members are all equal shareholders in the Cooperative, operating with the responsibilities of business co-owners. This means that co-op members set the strategic direction and are expected to keep sufficiently up to date to participate in a meaningful way. 

For members to meaningfully participate in the co-op, it’s important that we’ve all got the context for well-informed decision-making. We understand that people are working across time zones and in different ways, so members can stay informed in the way that works best for them – through reading reports, reaching out to other members, attending meetings (remotely or physically), etc. Members have different levels of capacity at different times and there are particular challenges associated with participating remotely, so we balance an expectation that people will do their best, with a culture of understanding and flexibility. 

The Constitution
The Loomio Cooperative Constitution is the legally-binding document that precisely defines the rights and responsibilities of membership. This policy document describes how we implement that legal agreement. The constitution can only be changed by a special resolution, i.e. 90% of the members must agree to it.

Joining and leaving co-op membership

Everyone working for Loomio on an ongoing basis is on a pathway to be invited into co-op membership. Typically, people will be invited into membership if they’ve worked with Loomio for about 12 months and it looks like they’ll be continuing for at least another 12 months. 

In technical terms, to be eligible for membership, a person needs to be ‘transacting’ with the Cooperative – in plain language, this means that they are currently working in Loomio (either in a paid role or for Loomio Points) or will be working in Loomio within a reasonable period of time. If you want to see the technical definition of ‘transacting’, check out the Loomio Cooperative Constitution.

Every six months, we’ll have a membership review. At this point, members will each consider whether they meet the basic criteria for being a transacting member, and communicate their self-assessment explicitly. The options at this stage are to remain a member and meet the membership eligibility criteria, decide to go on hiatus as described below, or surrender their member share.



Stepping back from membership
There are several reasons why a member may stop transacting, e.g. Loomio is not their current priority, there is no relevant opportunity right now, or perhaps there is a particular barrier that needs resolution before they can again transact within the cooperative.

When a member wants to step back…
If a member no longer feels committed to their member responsibilities, they might decide to check out their reasoning with their steward, or any of the other co-op members. This person will help the member figure out what they need in order to either re-engage, or to step back from membership.

Members can choose to go on hiatus for up to 12 months, without surrendering their share. While on hiatus, they are classed as ‘non-transacting members’. At any time during that period they can return to being a transacting member if they again meet the membership criteria and responsibilities, or they can surrender their share and cease being a member.

When a member doesn’t know how to contribute...
While there are not always enough paid jobs for everyone to do, there is always work available for any member who wants to contribute (valued through the Loomio Points system). The coordinators can help any member find something they are excited to work on, even a very small number of hours if their time capacity is limited.

When there is some other barrier to participating....
Where there is another barrier to participating as a member, your steward (or another person you trust within the co-op) can help. As we mature as an organisation, we are starting to develop policies to guide our actions in transparent ways as well (see for example the conflict resolution process). 

Legals
Change of ownership (shareholding) involves legal overhead, so we only add or remove members up to twice per year. If we want to add or remove anyone at a different time, people can join provisionally or indicate their intention to leave, before that six month interval is up.



Distribution of surplus

Membership may entitle you to a share of future distribution of surplus revenue, if and when the Board and Members decide together that surplus will be distributed. “Surplus” is what’s left of annual revenue after the operating expenses have been paid. It’s up to the Board to recommend to the members what proportion of the surplus is reinvested into the co-op, what proportion is directed to socially beneficial projects outside of Loomio, and what proportion is distributed to co-op members. Members must agree before the Board are able to act on any distribution. Being a member makes you eligible to receive the distribution. It does not mean any distribution will necessarily be made.


Loomio Points

We track unpaid work in the co-op with a system called “Loomio Points”. This applies to members and non-members alike, and is separate to distribution of surplus. Membership status does not affect Loomio Points.

Decision-making

Two important elements of the Loomio vision always inform our operational decision-making processes. First, the principle that anyone affected by a decision should be able to participate in making it, and second, the principle that a person’s influence over a decision should be in proportion to the degree to which it affects them. When decisions are made by a smaller group, they will take active steps to maintain their mandate from the wider group, and to operate transparently.

Kaitiakitanga - maintaining values and purpose

The members have made a commitment to creating and maintaining the culture of Loomio, doing their best to ensure it stays in line with the kaupapa (principles and purpose). In the worst-case scenario, this might involve asking someone to leave if their behaviour is undermining the principles that the co-op exists to promote.

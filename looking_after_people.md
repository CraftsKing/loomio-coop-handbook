# Looking after people

We have a huge emphasis on looking after people. We've learnt that when people are feeling happy and well, they do great work.

Whether it is the daily question, 'what are you doing for your wellbeing today?', to the [Well Working Group](well_working_group.md) who focus on enhancing the vibe, to the [stewardship system](stewarding.md) for distributing the work of caring for people.

# finding your way in an emergent organisation: structure, roles, rhythm

A lot of us Loomions have pretty strong opinions about how organisations should work. We love to DIY, to experiment with new forms, and to make space for people to bring their whole selves to the job. We don’t like hierarchy, positional authority, or out of date structures that get in the way of collaboration.

This means that all the structures we do have, were created from the ground up. They’re also liable to change a lot, as we keep looking for ways to do things better. Think of this document as a map to explain how all the pieces fit together.

After the big crowdfunding campaign in mid-2014, we came up with a whole new structure for the organisation, which previously was largely structureless. Here’s how it works:

## purpose: our guiding compass

Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone anywhere to participate in decisions that affect them. That’s our purpose, and we love it. Once that’s done we can all go home. The purpose comes first and foremost in all our decisions, and it has guided all of our organisational design.

## strategy: our best guess about the future

Strategy at Loomio emerges from the collective intelligence of everyone working on it.

Sometimes one person has a flash of insight (or a flash of the obvious) and will advocate strongly for a particular direction.

Other times there is a subtle sense of unease distributed among many people, the feeling that we’re not quite heading in the right direction. When that sense is brought out into the open and shared, we are capable of making significant course-corrections in very little time.

Explicit strategy-setting is a new practice for Loomio: we had our first attempt at the 2015 Summer retreat and will continue to develop. Our strategy is grounded in honoring the past, being ruthlessly honest about the present (using quantitative data and qualitative insights) and boldly envisioning the future.  We use bi-annual retreats to focus our strategy work, yet we aim to persistently scan what’s emerging externally and internally.  Strategy considers a longer term time horizon than 90 day planning and highly important but not urgent issues.  It is a chance to reflect, ask probing questions and aim to synthesize and align purpose (why we exist), product/service (what we do) and our organizational systems (how we do it).

## priorities: what we’re focussed on

Our aspirations are infinitely big, but unfortunately our resources are limited. Priorities tell us what piece we’re working on right now. Every three months we get together to develop our priorities for the next 90-day period. At a high level, the co-op members decide together what outcomes we’re going to focus on, and what proportion of the budget should go to each area.

## programs: where the work happens

All work at Loomio happens within a program. Every work program has a stated **outcome** (e.g. "engaged and growing userbase") + a **coordinator** + a share of the **budget** as allocated by the members.

All work programs are as **transparent** as possible, and as **participatory** as makes sense (e.g. the [Loomio product development roadmap](http://loomio.org/roadmap) is public, and the [Loomio Community](http://loomio.org/community) have input into it).

## roles & people: who’s doing the work

When you start working at Loomio, you’re a **contributor**. Your perspective as a newcomer is extremely valuable! We’d love to hear your insights and questions as we get to know each other.

All contributors should have a **steward** - you can find out more about stewards [here](stewarding.md).

Everyone working at Loomio is on a path to becoming a **member**. Members are co-owners of the cooperative. They act as *kaitiaki*: guardians of the culture and purpose of Loomio. We hold principles like... transparency, diversity, accessibility, individual/collective balance, inclusion, proportional influence, and openness.

Each work program has a **coordinator.** Coordinators hire staff and agree what their job will cover. They host regular meetings to help teams work together effectively. They also host collaborative processes to get input into decisions, e.g. from other people in the co-op, or from the wider Loomio Community. They regularly report on what’s going on in their program to the rest of the co-op. The members give the coordinators a temporary and retractable delegation to make decisions, within the parameters defined at the 90-day planning sessions. This delegation is reaffirmed every 3 months. So far Ben, Alanna, Chelsea, and Rich have held this role - our aspiration is to rotate this role throughout the membership.

We also have a **board**. At the moment, all board directors are co-op members, but there are times when we’ll have external people on the board too. The board provides additional accountability to the co-op, with a particular eye on long-term strategy and risks. They’re the good people that make sure we stay on the right side of the law.

## events: when we get together

In addition to the day-to-day meetings that will occur within your work program, we have a few other meetings that set a rhythm throughout the year.

Once per month there is a **members meeting** - this is a space for all the co-op members to get together to exchange news so everyone has full context. This meeting usually happens on the third Monday of the month.

**Board meeting** - the board meets once per month, on the Wednesday or Thursday after the members meeting.

**Away day** - every 3 months we get out of the office for a day to review the past quarter and plan the next one. At away days we do a collaborative priority-setting process, and choose coordinators for the next period.

**Retreat** - every 6 months we get right out of the city for a few days. This is a space for deeper connection, inspiration, and longer-term strategic thinking.

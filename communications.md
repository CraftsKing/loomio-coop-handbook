# swimming safely in the ocean of Loomio internal communications

Working at Loomio is probably a bit different to other places. We’re a decentralised organisation with a very dynamic structure and no explicit chain-of-command. This only works by operating in a high-communication environment.

Because all contributors have access to pretty much everything, anyone can share their insights and expertise. By swimming in information, we maximise our collective intelligence. Sometimes that high volume of information can be overwhelming and it starts to feel more like drowning than swimming.

We’re continuously improving our systems to strike the right balance and serve diverse needs. There’s a lot of DIY. We’re making it up as we go along. You’re at least as smart as anyone else here, so if you’ve got something you want to offer don’t wait for permission - just get started and pitch in, preferably with a friend to help :)

## we use Google Drive for collaborative documents

We use collaborative documents all the time. Google Drive handles our word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and file storage.

We love Drive a lot, but there are a few idiosyncrasies that can make it pretty confusing at first (don’t worry, it’s not just you):

1. One counter-intuitive thing you need to understand is this idea of "My Drive". When you log in to [drive.google.com](http://drive.google.com), the first thing you will see is My Drive. When someone shares a folder with you, if you want to be able to find it again later, make sure you move it into My Drive. This is [the Loomio folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_Yex4bwI5AnZ1EzZGJuM1doOEU&usp=sharing) - click the blue "Add to My Drive" button so you can find it next to you log in.

2. Using Google apps is frustrating when you have multiple accounts. We’ll share the Loomio folder with your @loomio.org email address. If you have another Google account that you want to use, you can share the folder with your other account too. Then you’ll always have access to all the Loomio docs regardless of what account you signed in with.

3. The other thing you need to get used to is the idea of finding files by searching, rather than browsing as you might be used to. The file structure changes as our organisation matures, which can make it hard to find something that you’ve been working on. The solution is to give your documents descriptive names, and periodically tidy them up into logical folders. So rather than "Meeting notes", call it “Product development meeting notes 2/2/15”.

## we use Loomio to build Loomio

As soon as you start contributing to Loomio, you should be added to the [Contributors group](https://www.loomio.org/g/j70ADGah/loomio-community-contributors). If you ever need to have a discussion with everyone on the team, send out an update relevant to everyone, or make a decision, feel free to start a discussion in there. You’re welcome to participate in all discussions posted in this group.

You’ll also see the coordinators’ reports delivered through this group regularly. This is the best way to keep up to date with what’s going on across the whole organisation. If you have limited time or information overload, just focus on reading these weekly reports. Feel free to ask any clarify questions, or share any other comments or feedback you have about reports.

There are a bunch of other Loomio groups you might want to join too:

* The [Loomio Community](https://www.loomio.org/g/WmPCB3IR/loomio-community) is a huge international community of Loomio users and supporters. We host discussions in that group when we need community input into our decision-making.

* More technically-oriented conversations about product development happen in the [Feature Ideas](https://www.loomio.org/g/GN7EFQTK/loomio-community-feature-ideas) group. It’s a great place to pitch an idea and see how other people feel about it.

* The [Coordinators group](https://www.loomio.org/g/7jWVDr04/loomio-community-group-coordinators) is a place for any user who is coordinating a Loomio group and wants to share best practices or ask questions of other coordinators.

## we use Trello as our shared todo list

We use a bunch of different Trello boards to coordinate our work. The one everyone needs to know about is the [Loomio Sprint Board](https://trello.com/b/skuMQvLJ/loomio-sprint-board). Here's how it works:

* the **Backlog** is all the work we're thinking about doing over the next few months;
* **Next up** is a list of all the jobs we're thinking about doing next sprint (a "sprint" is just a 2-week period of work)
* **Ready** is all the work we want to complete this sprint
* **In progress** is the work that is active right now
* There's a **Done** list for each sprint, where we put cards after they're complete. At the top of the list is the Sprint Summary card, which has our Goals, Capacity, and the items we want to Demo at the end of the sprint.

## we use Slack for instant messaging

Slack is a really nice tool we use for day-to-day real-time chat.

You can use Slack in your web browser or download their lovely apps. If you have an @loomio.org address, you can create an account and join us at [loomio.slack.com](http://loomio.slack.com). If you have trouble getting access, ask a coordinator.

You’ll automatically be in the #general channel, which is for everyone. You can also join other channels if you want to see what’s going on in the teams. You can send direct messages to anyone, which is great if you’ve just got a quick question that you want an immediate answer to. You can "star" the channels you want to keep up with and they will stick to the top of the list.

Mostly we use it to talk about the work *while we're working on it*. If you don't spend a lot of time doing Loomio work, or if you're not working during NZ business hours, you can ignore most of the activity on Slack and just pay attention when someone mentions you.

It can be really helpful to stay logged into Slack whenever you’re at your computer, so that if someone has a quick question for you, you are easily contactable. It’s not desirable or healthy for everyone to be contactable at all times, but the more you can be logged in to Slack, the more frictionless our daily comms can be.

## putting it all together

![Loomio comms chart](http://i.imgur.com/tt80uLD.png)

Here’s a common pattern you’ll see people use when they’re taking on a piece of work:

* Start a new document somewhere within the [Loomio folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_Yex4bwI5AnZ1EzZGJuM1doOEU&usp=sharing) - this will mean everyone on the team will be able to access it

* After you've sketched out the first draft, you might share a link to the doc in a Loomio discussion or in a Slack channel or an email.

* Now you have a couple of people collaborating on the doc together, they can edit the text directly, or add comments at specific points (mac users: option+command+M).

* Make sure the document permissions are set up the way you intend. If it’s in the shared folder, you’ll know everyone has access. Please make sure the doc has been shared with all the people you want to contribute, or is set to "anyone with the link". Receiving a request to collaborate on a document and then not being able to get in due to permissions is frustrating and slows the process down.

## asking for help

If you have a question about something you’re working on, you can talk to a coordinator. If you have a question about anything else in the co-op, you can ask your steward, ask on Slack (in a group channel or direct message), or email any individual in the co-op. If in doubt, you can always ask Rich!

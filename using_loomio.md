# Loomio Using Loomio

Every group and subgroup Loomio operates needs to:

* have a facilitator or facilitators
* have a clear purpose
* be clear about who should be in the group, and how they get in
* be clear about what a decision means
* proactively choose its privacy settings

Facilitation guidelines for internal groups:

* Keep an eye on participation - is something a topic that everyone needs to weigh in on? If so tag them, if not let it go. Are we hearing from all the voices we need to?
* Prompt for proposals in more/many/most discussions
* Thinking about if we're doing what we can to dogfood on our tool, and capture feedback from doing so
* Encourage people to post on Loomio more, to include people who aren't in the room, on chat at that moment, etc
* Make sure the right people are in the group (such as when a new staff member joins, etc)

# Loomio Points

Because Loomio is a cooperative, owned equally by its members, we don't have [sweat equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_equity) in the same way as some other startups. 

Instead, we have a separate system to acknowledge the work people did for free to get the project off the ground, and the opportunity cost staff wear by accepting pay below market rates while we get the business going. We acknowledge the risk workers took giving their time to an early stage startup with no guarantees by putting a multiplier on points earned during the early days. 

People keep their Loomio Points even if they leave the co-op, and they are totally separate to ownership  or investment shares.
